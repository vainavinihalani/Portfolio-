  <p class="text-container">or the merchandise concept, we’re taking that same dramatic Gothic energy and filtering it through the raw, rebellious spirit of rock music. The mood board blends detailed arches, ornate patterns, and flowing lines with bold, edgy graphics that match the band’s sound. Prints echo the shapes of cathedral archways, while the designs and lettering borrow from the delicate patterns you’d find in the arches.
The result is a striking mix of old-world elegance and modern rebellion — wearable art that feels both historic and fiercely alive, just like the music it’s made for.</p>
